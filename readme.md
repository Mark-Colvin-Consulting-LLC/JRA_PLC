**June 2023
Last month Mark is scheduled with JR Automation. Fort Worth location is too far from Dallas address, GXO support pay is very low for the skills required, JR Automation project seems to be open-ended, with no clear final design or goals. July was last scheduled time for Mark C, no further schedule on on-going expansion. Asked Sterling Staffing for local assignments, none to be had.
